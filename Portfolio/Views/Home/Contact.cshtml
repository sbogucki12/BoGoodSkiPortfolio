        <p><b><i>Steve was born in</i></b> Philadelphia, USA, raised in North Dakota, enjoys running, and loves his dog, Roux. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Following four years in the active duty Army, Steve graduated from the University of South Florida (Go Bulls!) Magna Cum Laude. After college, Steve built a successful career in the Federal Aviation Administration, first beginning with communication responsibilities at the FAA’s Washington, DC policy headquarters, later maintaining databases, serving as the stakeholder representative for a large Software Development Life Cycle project, and eventually becoming among the youngest managers in the agency. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Though eternally grateful for the success, the promotions were quick enough that Steve was before long managing instead of performing discrete software development duties.  Software development being a passion, Steve departed the FAA to take on software development as a fulltime career.  Since leaving the FAA, Steve has been a freelance software developer. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Steve is available for hire, either full-time or for contract positions.  Currently, Steve’s software development expertise is focused on C#, .NET (Core and MVC 5), Entity Framework, MySQL, SQL Server and associated segments of the backend stack; with less, though working knowledge of frontend technologies such as AngularJS and jQuery.  Steve’s immediate professional goal is to add to his knowledge of React, such that he can apply it with the same aptitude that he works with backend frameworks. </p>
